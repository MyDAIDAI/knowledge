Alright, Peppa is the detective. George, I'm the detective. I will help you find Mister Dinosaur. Maybe the Mister Dinosaur should ask George some simple questions. George, where is the Mister Dinosaur? George does not know where Mister Dinosaur is. The detective could try and guess where Mister Dinosaur might be. I know, I know where he is. George always has Mister Dinosaur with him in the bath. So Mister Dinosaur is in the bath. Mister Dinosaur is not in the bath. Oh, I know. I know  where Mister Dinosaur is. George always has Mister Dinosaur in his bed at night.So that's where he is. Maybe we should try the garden. I was going to say that. Where is Mister Dinosaur? Mister Dinosaur is very hard to find. Mister Dinosaur isn't anywhere. George, You do love to throw Mister Dinosaur in the air, I wonder if the time you threw Mister Dinosaur just a bit too high. There he is. There he is. I saw him first.
