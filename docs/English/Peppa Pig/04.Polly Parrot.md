# Polly Parrot

Peppa and her family are visiting Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig.Hello, my little ones.Come inside, we have a surprise. What is it? We have a new pet. Can you guess what it is? Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig have a pet parrot. Peppa, George, this is our pet parrot. She's called Polly. I'm a clever parrot. Mummy, why does Polly copy everything that Granny says? That's what parrots do. I'll show you. What a sweet little parrot. Come on, everyone, teatime. There's chocolate cake! Coming, Granny. Peppa and George love eating chocolate cake. But today, they are in a hurry to get back and play with Poly Parrot. Finished! What noisy little ones you are! Granny, please can we leave the table and go and see Polly Parrot? Are sure you've completely finished your cake? Off you go, then. George, say something to Polly. George is a little bit shy. Peppa and George are really enjoying playing with Polly Parrot.
George, say something. Peppa and George are pretending to be parrots.
